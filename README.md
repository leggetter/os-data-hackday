# Open Source Data Hackday - Saturday 28th May

With data on 8m repositories, 7m issues/pull requests and 33m dependencies, Libraries.io has a wealth of data that can be used to help open source projects by highlighting key issues or important projects that need more help.

It currently has a basic API but much more advanced ones could be built to make data extraction easier to build tools on top of it.

The whole project is open source and ready for contributions and improvements: https://github.com/librariesio
